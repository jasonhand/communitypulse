Kevin McIntosh is a professional software developer of 10 years, working as a Software Engineer as well as a brief stint recently as an internal developer advocate at Groupon, focusing on cloud migration adoption internally.  His personal focus throughout his career has been wide, from leading LGBTQ+ employee resource groups with a focus on community growth and diverse recruiting pipelines, to improving scalable web systems through better design practices in Kubernetes, and a focus on how Javascript can be used effectively throughout tech stacks.  Despite moving on from Developer Advocacy, he still focuses on a developer-first approach in identifying solutions for internal tools and practices through advocacy while still trying to get outdoors and experience the wildernesses that surround Seattle.
