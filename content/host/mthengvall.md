Mary Thengvall is a connector of people at heart, both personally and professionally. She loves digging into the strategy of how to build and foster developer communities and has been doing so for over 10 years. After building community programs at O’Reilly Media, Chef Software, and SparkPost, she consulted for two years, helping companies build a strong and sustainable Developer Relations strategy. These days, Mary is the Director of Developer Relations at Camunda. In addition to her work, she's known for being "the one with the dog," thanks to her ever-present medical alert service dog Ember. She's the author of the first book on Developer Relations: [The Business Value of Developer Relations](http://persea-consulting.com/book) (© 2018, Apress). Mary also curates DevRel Weekly, a weekly newsletter that brings you a curated list of articles, job postings, and events, and is a board member of the DevRel Collective Slack team.
