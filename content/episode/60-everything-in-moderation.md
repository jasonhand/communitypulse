title = "Everything in Moderation"
Description = "One of the most difficult parts of managing a community is ensuring everyone adheres to a universally acceptable system of behavior. With events, there is generally a Code of Conduct that makes it clear what behaviors are acceptable, what behaviors aren’t, and the consequences of operating outside of the rules. Sometimes it falls on an individual or a team to handle this in the online world. Today, we’ll be talking about moderation with a guest who knows exactly how it works."
