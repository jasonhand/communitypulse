title = "Virtual Events and ROI - Are we getting our Money's Worth"
Description = "Over the last year, we‚Äôve talked about virtual events quite a bit - from how to get started to bringing things together in a short period of time. That said, being a sponsor at these virtual events has been somewhat of a challenge. With no real ‚Äúbooth‚Äù or physical location for interaction, where can value be found in these events and how do we show the benefits to our sponsoring organizations. To discuss this, we brought together a few folks who have experienced virtual events from different points of view."
